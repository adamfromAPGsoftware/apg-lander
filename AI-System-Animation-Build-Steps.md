# AI System Animation â€“ Build Steps

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for building the interactive AI System animation as described in the planning document.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- Create a new React project (or use your existing one):
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app ai-system-visualization --template typescript
  # or use Next.js, Vite, etc.
  ```
- Set up your preferred code style, linting, and version control.

---

## 2. Install Required Libraries

- **React Flow** (for node/edge layout and interactivity):
  ```bash
  npm install @xyflow/react
  ```
- **Framer Motion** (for animation):
  ```bash
  npm install framer-motion
  ```
- **shadcn/ui** (optional, for modern UI components):
  ```bash
  npx shadcn-ui@latest init
  # or follow the shadcn/ui setup instructions
  ```
- (Optional) **GSAP** or **Three.js** for advanced animation/3D effects.

---

## 3. Component Structure

- Create a main container component, e.g., `AISystemAnimation.tsx`.
- Plan subcomponents:
  - `AIKnowledgeBaseNode`
  - `AISystemNode`
  - `AIAgentNode` (for each mini agent)
  - `CRMNode`
  - `DataNode`
  - (Optional) `DataPointNode` for individual data points
- Use React Flow to manage the node/edge graph and layout.

---

## 4. Node & Edge Layout

- Define the initial positions for:
  - AI Knowledge Base (top center)
  - AI System (center)
  - Mini AI Agents (orbiting/clustered around AI System)
  - CRM (bottom left)
  - Data (bottom right)
- Use React Flow's node and edge APIs to create and connect these nodes.
- Style nodes for clarity and visual appeal (glowing, pulsing, etc.).

---

## 5. Animation Implementation

- Use Framer Motion to animate:
  - Node pulsing/glowing
  - Mini agents orbiting or clustering
  - Animated arrows/edges (data flow)
- Optionally, use GSAP or Three.js for more advanced or 3D effects.

---

## 6. Interactivity

- Add hover/click handlers to nodes and agents:
  - Highlight connections and animate data flow
  - Show tooltips or modals with feature explanations
  - Optionally, allow users to "trace" a data flow path
- Use React Flow's event system for node/edge selection and interaction.

---

## 7. Accessibility

- Ensure all nodes and interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- Add ARIA labels and descriptions for screen readers.
- Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

---

## 8. Testing & Iteration

- Test the animation and interactivity on different devices and browsers.
- Optimize performance (reduce animation complexity for mobile if needed).
- Gather feedback and iterate on design, animation, and usability.

---

## 9. Polish & Launch

- Refine visuals, transitions, and responsiveness.
- Add documentation and usage instructions if needed.
- Deploy to your production environment.

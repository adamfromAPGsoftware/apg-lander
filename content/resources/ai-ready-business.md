# Is Your Business AI-Ready? A Self-Assessment Guide

AI is transforming every industry. But here's the uncomfortable truth: **most service businesses aren't ready to leverage it.**

Not because they lack ambition or resources—but because their data is scattered across 10-20 disconnected tools, making AI implementation virtually impossible.

This guide will help you assess your AI readiness and create a roadmap to get there.

## The AI Readiness Framework

We evaluate businesses across five dimensions:

1. Data Centralization
2. Data Quality
3. Process Documentation
4. Technical Infrastructure
5. Team Readiness

Let's assess each one.

## 1. Data Centralization Assessment

**Ask yourself:**

- Can you get a complete view of any customer in under 60 seconds?
- Is your customer data in one place, or scattered across multiple tools?
- Do you have a single source of truth for projects/jobs?
- Can you pull reports without manually exporting from multiple systems?

**Score yourself:**
- 🔴 Poor: Data in 5+ disconnected systems
- 🟡 Fair: Data in 2-4 systems with some integration
- 🟢 Good: Centralized data with real-time sync

**Why it matters for AI**: AI models need access to comprehensive data. If your customer history is split between your CRM, email, and project management tool, AI can't see the full picture.

## 2. Data Quality Assessment

**Ask yourself:**

- How often do you find duplicate records?
- Is data entry consistent (same format for phone numbers, addresses, etc.)?
- Are old/inactive records properly archived?
- Do you have data validation rules in place?

**Score yourself:**
- 🔴 Poor: Frequent duplicates, inconsistent formatting
- 🟡 Fair: Some cleanup needed, basic validation
- 🟢 Good: Clean data, strict validation rules

**Why it matters for AI**: Garbage in, garbage out. AI trained on messy data produces unreliable results.

## 3. Process Documentation Assessment

**Ask yourself:**

- Are your core business processes documented?
- Could a new hire follow the documentation to complete key tasks?
- Do you track process exceptions and edge cases?
- When was your documentation last updated?

**Score yourself:**
- 🔴 Poor: Processes exist in team members' heads
- 🟡 Fair: Basic documentation, some gaps
- 🟢 Good: Comprehensive, regularly updated documentation

**Why it matters for AI**: AI automation requires clear, documented rules. "We just know how to do it" doesn't translate to AI instructions.

## 4. Technical Infrastructure Assessment

**Ask yourself:**

- Do your tools have APIs for data access?
- Can you export your data at any time?
- Do you have technical support (internal or external)?
- Are your systems integrated or operating in silos?

**Score yourself:**
- 🔴 Poor: Locked into vendor platforms, no integration
- 🟡 Fair: Some API access, limited integration
- 🟢 Good: Open systems, full data portability

**Why it matters for AI**: AI needs programmatic access to your data and systems. Locked-down SaaS tools limit what's possible.

## 5. Team Readiness Assessment

**Ask yourself:**

- Does leadership understand AI opportunities and limitations?
- Are team members open to new tools and processes?
- Do you have a clear vision for how AI could help?
- Is there budget allocated for AI initiatives?

**Score yourself:**
- 🔴 Poor: No awareness, resistance to change
- 🟡 Fair: Curious but unclear on direction
- 🟢 Good: Clear vision, team buy-in, budget allocated

**Why it matters for AI**: Technology alone doesn't transform businesses. You need people ready to embrace and optimize AI tools.

## Calculate Your AI Readiness Score

Add up your scores:
- 🔴 = 1 point
- 🟡 = 2 points
- 🟢 = 3 points

**Total Score Interpretation:**

**5-8 points: Not AI-Ready**
Your business needs foundational work before AI can deliver value. Focus on data centralization and quality first.

**9-12 points: Getting There**
You have some building blocks in place. Targeted improvements can unlock AI opportunities within 6-12 months.

**13-15 points: AI-Ready**
You're in a strong position to leverage AI. Start with pilot projects and scale what works.

## The Path to AI Readiness

**Priority actions:**
1. Conduct a full software stack audit
2. Identify your 3-5 core systems of record
3. Create a data centralization plan
4. Implement basic data quality controls
5. Document your core processes

**Timeline**: 3-6 months of focused effort

### If you scored 9-12 points:

**Priority actions:**
1. Close remaining integration gaps
2. Deep-clean your data
